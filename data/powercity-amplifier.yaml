description: |
  Amplifier is an automated front-end to the Liquity lending protocol that will support multiple implementations
  on Ethereum and PulseChain (Liquity on Ethereum, EARN Protocol and Liquid Loans on PulseChain).
  Liquity is trustless and immutable, allowing anyone to create a custom front-end to the lending protocol.
  Amplifier simplifies the operation of Liquity’s many functions while also automating several leveraged trading
  strategies so you don’t need to continually track market prices to time the strategies properly.

  Amplifier supports the following protocols built off the Liquity code: EARN Protocol, Liquid Loans, Liquity.

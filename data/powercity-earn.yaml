description: |
  EARN is a decentralized borrowing protocol that allows you to draw interest-free loans against PLSX used as collateral.
  Loans are paid out in PXDC (a USD pegged stablecoin) and need to maintain a minimum collateral ratio of 110%.
  
  In addition to the collateral, the loans are secured by a Stability Pool containing PXDC and by fellow borrowers collectively
  acting as guarantors of last resort. Learn more about these mechanisms under Liquidation.
  
  EARN as a protocol is non-custodial, immutable, and governance-free.
